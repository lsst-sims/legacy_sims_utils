class ObservationMetaData(object):
    """Observation Metadata

    This class contains any metadata for a query which is associated with
    a particular telescope pointing, including bounds in RA and DEC, and
    the time of the observation.

    **Parameters**

        * pointing[RA,Dec] float
          The coordinates of the pointing (in degrees)

        * boundType characterizes the shape of the field of view.  Current options
          are 'box, and 'circle'

        * boundLength is the characteristic length scale of the field of view in degrees.
          If boundType is 'box', boundLength can be a float(in which case boundLength is
          half the length of the side of each box) or boundLength can be a numpy array
          in which case the first argument is
          half the width of the RA side of the box and the second argument is half the
          Dec side of the box.
          If boundType is 'circle,' this will be the radius of the circle.
          The bound will be centered on the point (pointingRA, pointingDec),
          however, because objects are stored at their mean RA, Dec in the LSST databases
          (i.e. they are stored at values of RA, Dec which neglect precession, nutation,
          aberration, and refraction), the bounds applied to database queries will be made
          slightly larger so that queries can be reasonably expected to return all of the
          objects within the desired field of view once those corrections have been applied.

        * mjd : (optional)
          Either a float (in which case, it will be assumed to be in International
          Atomic Time), or an instnatiation of the ModifiedJulianDate class representing
          the date of the observation

        * bandpassName : a char (e.g. 'u') or list (e.g. ['u', 'g', 'z'])
          denoting the bandpasses used for this particular observation

        * phoSimMetaData : dict (optional)
          a dictionary containing metadata used by PhoSim

        * m5: float or list (optional)
          this should be the 5-sigma limiting magnitude in the bandpass or
          bandpasses specified in bandpassName.  Ultimately, m5 will be stored
          in a dict keyed to the bandpassName (or Names) you passed in, i.e.
          you will be able to access m5 from outside of this class using, for
          example:

          myObservationMetaData.m5['u']

        * skyBrightness: float (optional) the magnitude of the sky in the
          filter specified by bandpassName

        * seeing float or list (optional)
          Analogous to m5, corresponds to the seeing in arcseconds in the bandpasses in
          bandpassName

        * epoch (optional) is the epoch used for converting from pointingRA, Dec to
          meanRA, Dec when constructing query bounds on a database.  This defaults
          to 2000.0 and should only be changed if you plan to use this
          ObservationMetaData to query a database with meanRA, Dec stored in a
          system that is not measured against the equinox at Julian epoch 2000.0

        * rotSkyPos float (optional)
          The orientation of the telescope in degrees.
          This is used by the Astrometry mixins in sims_coordUtils.

        The convention for rotSkyPos is as follows:

        rotSkyPos = 0 means north is in the +y direction on the camera and east is -x

        rotSkyPos = 90 means north is -x and east is -y

        rotSkyPos = -90 means north is +x and east is +y

        rotSkyPos = 180 means north is -y and east is +x

        This should be consistent with PhoSim conventions.

    **Examples**::
        >>> data = ObservationMetaData(boundType='box', pointingRA=5.0, pointingDec=15.0,
                    boundLength=5.0)
